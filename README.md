## **Description**

- Simple Tic-tac-toe game built as part of The Odin Project
- The Game features Player vs Player, Player vs Computer, and Computer vs Computer modes
- This project was built to get more familiar with structurizing the code using modules and factory functions


## **Work in progress**

- For now, the Computer moves are random and there is no difference between "EASY" and "HARD" mode. I'm working on the algorithm to enable more thoughtful moves
